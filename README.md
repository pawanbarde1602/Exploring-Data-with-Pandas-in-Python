# Exploring Data with Pandas in Python
Recently, I practiced working with Pandas, one of the most powerful Python libraries for data analysis. ðŸ“Š

In this project, I worked with a dataset (data.csv) and explored different operations, including:
âœ… Reading and loading CSV files
âœ… Checking dataset shape, columns, and data types
âœ… Handling missing values
âœ… Selecting specific rows and columns
âœ… Performing slicing operations
âœ… Summarizing data using describe()
âœ… Renaming columns for clarity

This hands-on practice helped me understand how to clean, analyze, and prepare data effectively using Pandas. Itâ€™s a small but important step in my data science journey! âœ¨
